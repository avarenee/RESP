**RESP -RESPONSIVE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT PROTOCOLS**

RESP is an early intervention application with facial recognition  for first responders  to connect loved ones  after a Natural Disaster on ways to minimize the emotional consequences  and helping  families cope  in ways that is conducive to mental health and wellbeing.

**SOLUTION**

RESP is an early intervention application for first responders with facial recognition and accessible offline platform that connect loved ones  after a natural disaster on ways to minimize the emotional consequences and helping families cope in ways that is conducive to mental health and wellbeing. 

RESP - Questionnaire is intended for the first responder to fill out, inspired by the recommended questions asked for AMBER Alert system. This information is not only intended to establish a rapport with the disaster survivor, but populated an anonymous database to allow the custom ML models to consume.  

Once first responders fill out a questionnaire, they are added to the Catalog and considered 'checked-in'. The survivor may  state that they are seeking family members or friends, and if a match is found between their query and the Catalog, the survivor can be notified and reassured. The catalog keeps track of a census, geolocation based on their responses.

How we built it: React, MongoDb Stitch, Service Worker to facilitate offline sync and IBM cloud.

Potential impact:  RESP can help  a community to reconnect with loved ones  to reduce the Emotional Impact of a Natural Disaster for long-term prevention.
