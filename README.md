**RESP - RESPONSIVE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT PROTOCOLS**

RESP is an application for use by first responders to reconnect loved ones after a natural disaster. RESP aims to minimize the psychological damage caused by natural disaster, fostering community mental wellness.

**SOLUTION**

Once first responders intervene, they can use RESP's 'check-in' feature to interview survivors. The interview survey keeps track of basic information about the survivor, such as their name, birthday, and, if they are displaced, a shelter for them to be assigned to. The survivors are then added to the database and considered 'checked-in'. The survivor may state that they are seeking family members or friends, and if a match is found between their query and the database, the survivor can be notified and reassured.

How we built it: React, MongoDb Stitch, Service Worker to facilitate offline sync and IBM cloud.

Currently hosted on Bluemix: https://resp.mybluemix.net/

**Potential impact**  

RESP can help a community to reconnect with loved ones to reduce the short term and long term emotional impact of a natural disaster.
